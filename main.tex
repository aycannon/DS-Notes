\section{Regression}

We want to predict the response $y$ from inputs $\mathbf{x} = (1, x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_p)$. We can do this by modelling the \hl{conditional mean of $y$ conditional on $\mathbf{x}$}

\section{Cross Validation}

\section{Regularisation}

\subsection{PCR}
We talk about PCA in more detail in Section \ref{sec:PCA}

PCR offers a prediction technique and reduces the risk of overfitting through dimension reduction. We have found the principal components through PCA, we could use those components for regression. 

\section{Classification}

\section{Tree-Based Methods}

Tree-based methods are simple and useful for interpretation but are usually not competitive with the best supervised learning approaches. We start to introduce techniques that make drastic improvements on the simple decision tree, like bagging and random forests.


\subsection{Decision Trees}

A logical system to map regressors to outcomes. They are \hl{hierarchical} meaning they use a series of ordered steps to come to a conclusion. We will be using data on baseball player salaries.

To illustrate, here is a decision tree:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{pic/decision tree.png}
    \caption{Decision Tree}
    \label{fig:decision tree}
\end{figure}

In this example, we are predicting player salaries and using the regressor \lstinline{hits} and \lstinline{years}. This decision tree can be visualised like so:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{pic/decision tree parts.png}
    \caption{Decision Tree as Data}
    \label{fig:decision tree parts}
\end{figure}

At our \hl{primary node} we check whether the player has been in the league for less than 4.5 years. If so, we continue on the left. If the player has been in the league for over 4.5 years, then we continue to the next node on the right (hits $< 117.5$). The $R_1$ section in Figure \ref{fig:decision tree parts} corresponds to the left-most \hl{leaf} in Figure \ref{fig:decision tree}. $R_2$ corresponds to the middle leaf and $R_3$ corresponds to the right-most leaf. 

\begin{note}
    From both these Figures (\ref{fig:decision tree} \ref{fig:decision tree parts}) we can infer that, the average (log) salary for a player with less than 4.5 years of experience is 5.11; a player with more than 4.5 years of experience but less than 117.5 hits has an average (log) salary of 6.00; and a player with more than 4.5 years experience and more than 117.5 hits has an average (log) salary of 6.74.
\end{note}

\begin{shaded}
    \textbf{Terminology:}

    The tree splits input space $\mathbf{x} = \text{years, hits})$ in final nodes called \textbf{leafs}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $R_1 = \{\mathbf{x}|\text{years} < 4.5\}$
        \item $R_2 = \{\mathbf{x}|\text{years} \geq 4.5, \text{hits}<117.5\}$
        \item $R_3 = \{\mathbf{x}|\text{years} \geq 4.5, \text{hits}\geq 117.5\}$
    \end{itemize}

    Points on the tree where input space is split are called \textbf{internal nodes}. Segments connecting the nodes are \textbf{branches}.
\end{shaded}

So far we have an extremely simple tree, so we must grow it.

\subsubsection{Growing the Tree}

\begin{definition}
    Split $\mathbf{x}$-space in $J$ distinct, non-overlapping regions, $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_J$. Suppose $\mathbf{x}_i \in R_j$; then the prediction for $y_i$ is $\hat{y} = \Bar{y} \equiv \frac{1}{n_j}\sum_{k:\mathbf{x}_k\in R_j} y_k$. Where $n_j$ is the number of observations that belong to $R_j$.

    \begin{note}
        This just means that for a given set of nodes (classifiers), our prediction will be the average of all the observations that fit said classifiers.
    \end{note}

    $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_J$ are chosen to minimise the \textbf{loss function} (deviance).

    \begin{itemize}
        \item When $y$ is real: loss is the sum of squared errors (=regression deviance)

        \begin{equation*}
            \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \sum_{j=1}^J \sum_{k:\mathbf{x}_k\in R_j}(y_k - \Bar{y})
        \end{equation*}

        \item When $y$ is binary: loss is the Gini impurity (or logit deviance)

        \begin{equation*}
            \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y}_i(1-\hat{y}_i)^2 = \sum_{j=1}^J \sum_{k:\mathbf{x}_k\in R_j} \Bar{y}_j(1-\Bar{y}_j)^2
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Many ways to describe this algorithm:

The algorithm is \hl{greedy} as it makes the \textbf{locally} best choice at every step (similar to the forward step-wise regression). \hl{top-down} as it starts at the top of the tree. \hl{Recursive} as it solves the same problem in each step.

\subsubsection{Recursive Binary Splitting}

The node, $m$, is not split (leaf) it contributes cost:

\begin{equation*}
    \text{non-split node-}m \text{ cost} = \sum_{k:\mathbf{x}_k\in R_m}(y_k - \hat{y}R_m)^2
\end{equation*}

What the algorithm is doing is finding $x_j \in \{x_1, \ldots, x_p\}$ and cutoff $s$ to split $\mathbf{x}$-space into node-$m$ children

\begin{equation*}
    R_{left} = \{\mathbf{x}|x_j<s\}; \qquad R_{right} = \{\mathbf{x}|x_j \geq s\}
\end{equation*}

to minimise our cost function:

\begin{equation*}
    \text{split-node-}m \text{ cost} = \underbrace{\sum_{k:\mathbf{x}_k\in R_{left}}(y_k - \hat{y}R_{left})^2}_{\text{left cost}} + \underbrace{\sum_{k:\mathbf{x}_k\in R_{right}}(y_k - \hat{y}R_{right})^2}_{\text{right cost}}
\end{equation*}

So we are determining which parent node $m$ gives the maximum cost reduction by splitting, \hl{i.e. which regressor and cutoff reduces the cost function the most}. We keep doing this until a \textbf{convergence criterion} is met. This can be that each region (leaf) contains at least 3 observations. Or each split has to contribute a minimum decrease in deviance e.g. 0.001.


    
\begin{algo}

Tree creation:

\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}[SIR/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},]
%Nodes
\node[SIR] (1)     {Find optimal split - $x_j$ and cutoff $s$ to minimise loss};
\node[SIR] (2)[below=of 1] {Split this parent node into the left and right children};
\node[SIR] (3) [below=of 2] {each of these children are now parent nodes};

%Lines
\draw[->, very thick] (1.south)  to node[right] {} (2.north);
\draw[->, very thick] (2.south)  to node[right] {} (3.north);
\draw[->, very thick] (3.east) .. controls  +(right:7mm) and +(right:7mm)   .. (1.east);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
    
\end{algo}


This continues recursively until you reach a leaf node of some prespecified minimum size.

\subsubsection{Overfitting Our Tree}

\hl{When our tree is deep, it tends to be overfit}. The nonparametric nature of tree regressions means that it is very easy to overfit the data with an overgrown tree, leading to poor OOS predictions. An overgrown tree will be able to fit nonlinear mean and interaction effects without having to specify them (unlike linear regressions).

We have to prune the tree to constrain the flexibility and get better OOS predictions. We do this by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item construct a regularisation path of trees (from deep to shallow)
    \item Cross validate models along the path
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cost Complexity Pruning}

A smaller tree with few splits (fewer regions) might lead to lower variance and better interpretation at the cost of a little bias. If we were to set the constraints very high (high minimum decrease in deviance) we may accidentally grow the tree too short and we miss a large reduction in RSS because of a small decrease before it. 

To avoid this we can grow a very complex and deep tree and then \textit{prune} it back in order to obtain a \hl{subtree}.

\begin{definition}
    \hl{Cost Complexity Pruning selects a sequence of subtrees} indexed by $\alpha>0$. Let $T_0$ be the complex tree; for each $\alpha>0$ find subtree $T_\alpha\subset T_0$ such that

    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{j=1}^{|T_\alpha}\sum_{k:\mathbf{x}_k\in R_k}(y_k - \Bar{y}_j)^2 + \alpha|T_\alpha|
    \end{equation}

    is minimised.

    \begin{note}
        $|T_\alpha|$ s the number of leaves on $T_\alpha$
    \end{note}

    Our \textbf{hyper-parameter} $\alpha$ penalises complexity (number of leaves); by varying $\alpha$ we obtain a regularisation path from complex to simple.

    \begin{note}
        $\alpha=0$ gives us the full tree. $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$ gives us a tingle leaf, $|T| = 1$.
    \end{note}

    We evaluate the OOS deviance for every tree on the path by cross-validation, then pick the subtree with the minimum OOS deviance.
\end{definition}



\subsubsection{Pros and Cons of Trees}

\begin{shaded}
    Pros:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[+] Easy to explain (probably easier than regressions)
        \item[+] Can be argued that decision trees more closely mirror human decision making than regressions and classification methods
        \item[+] Easy to graph and interpret
        \item[+] Can easily handle qualitative regressors without the need for dummy variables.
    \end{itemize}

    Cons:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] Do not tend to have the same predictive accuracy that regression models have 
        \item[-] Can be very unstable. Small changes in the data lead to drastic changes in the tree.
    \end{itemize}
\end{shaded}


\subsection{Ensemble Methods}


Trees can easily lead to overfitting. You \textit{can} do model selection by cross-validation, but the results are unstable and thus unreliable and impractical. Because there are no coefficients, we can't penalise the coefficients like we did before (we have now penalised the number of coefficients). 

Instead, we grow a \hl{forest} (= many trees) and regularise by \hl{bagging to obtain the random forest predictor}.



An ensemble method combines many simple models (aka "weak learners") to obtain a single powerful model. We look at both \hl{bagging and random forest} as ensemble methods that give better predictive power and stability.

\begin{note}
    We often see that when we use the ensemble approach there is usually a loss of interpretation in the final model.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Bagging}

An overgrown tree is typically overfitted i.e. low bias and high variance. Bagging offers a way of reducing the variance of a tree based on the idea that \textbf{averaging reduces variance}.

\begin{definition}
    Bagging:

    Suppose we have $B$ training datasets so we could grow $B$ trees. Given inputs $\mathbf{x}$, we can make $B$ predictions $\hat{y}^b(\mathbf{x})$; averaging yields

    \begin{equation*}
        \hat{y}_{avg}(\mathbf{x}) = \dfrac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \hat{y}^b(\mathbf{x})
    \end{equation*}

    which is the \textbf{bagging predictor}. 
\end{definition}

Bagging is an average of i.i.d trees and the bagging predictor has lower variance than each individual tree. We do not have $B$ datasets, we only have 1 so we \hl{resample with replacement} to create $B$ datasets.

\begin{note}
    resampling with replacement means that an individual observation can be sampled multiple times in one dataset.
\end{note}
\subsubsection{Random Forests}

Random forest is a slightly modified bagging procedure. The splits in the fitted trees are chosen optimally across a random sample of inputs (meaning at on a specific tree, each node only has the choice of a few of the original regressors to make the split).

It is this random selection of predictors at each node that reduces the correlation between the trees grown at the different bootstrapped training samples. This decorrelation may induce some bias in the prediction, it also reduces the prediction variance and often improves the prediction accuracy.

\subsubsection{Out-Of-Bag Error}

We can estimate the the test MSE by cross validation but for bagging-based predictors there is an easier way: \textbf{out-of-bag error} (OOB error).

It can be shown that each bagged tree utilises only around two-thirds of the observations. The remaining one-third of the observations not used to fit a given bagged tree are referred to as the out-of-bag observations. We can predict the response for the $i$th observation using each of the trees in which that observation was OOB. This will yield around $B/3$ predictions which we can then average over (for regressions) or take majority vote (classification models).

\section{Unsupervised Learning}

So far, our main objective has been dimension reduction on big data  i.e. learn low dimensional summary stats necessary for good decisions from high dimensional input $\mathbf{x}$. And \hl{so far, this has all be supervised}, i.e. we have a target variable $y$ (regress target $y$ on high dimensional $\mathbf{x}$ ti get one dimensional $\hat{y} = \mathbf{x}^\prime\hat{\beta}$).

\hl{In unsupervised machine learning there is no target or outcome variable.} We still have a high dimensional input $\mathbf{x}$, and we still want dimension reduction. It is common to find partially labelled data and in this case we often use unsupervised learning to split the data into groups; then use the labelled data to predict.

\subsubsection{Mixture models}

Cluster analysis is used to collect similar observations into groups. Suppose data $(\mathbf{x}_i)_{i=1}^n$ where $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p)$ is a vector with $p$ characteristics. Clustering represents the data as output from a mixture distribution.

\paragraph{Mixture Distribution}: $\mathbf{x}_i$ is drawn from one of $K$ \textbf{mixture components} $p_k(\mathbf{x}), k = 1, 2, \ldots, K$. These mixture components are multivariate distributions of $\mathbf{x}$. 

The \textit{Guassian mixture model} where $p$ characterises $\mathbf{x}$ are i.i.d with variance $\sigma_k^2$ is a common clustering model;

\begin{equation}
    p_k(\mathbf{x}_i) = \dfrac{1}{(2\pi\sigma_k^2)^{p/2}}\exp\left[-\dfrac{\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij}-\mu_{kj})^2}{2\sigma_k^2}\right]
\end{equation}

With our unlabelled data we do not know which of $K$ components $\mathbf{x}_i$ is from. We only see the characteristics of the observations:

\begin{equation*}
    p(\mathbf{x}_i) = \pi_1 p_1(\mathbf{x}_i) + \pi_2 p_2 (\mathbf{x}_i) + \ldots + \pi_k p_k (\mathbf{x}_i)
\end{equation*}

where $\pi_k$ is the probability that $\mathbf{x}_i$ comes from the component $k$.

\subsection{Factorisation by K-Means}

We look at K-means as a way to model mixture models. This means the data comes from differing distributions and because of this it is important to group the data to match this.

K-means clustering is a way of grouping observations and it comes from a simple and intuitive maths problem.

\begin{definition}
    Let $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_K$ denote sets containing the indices of the observations in each cluster. These sets satisfy

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $C_1 \cup C_2 \cup \ldots \cup C_K = \{1, \ldots, n\}$. i.e. all observations are accounted for.

        \item $C_k \cap C_{k^\prime} = \varnothing \quad \forall k \neq k^\prime$. i.e. clusters do not overlap. No observation belongs to multiple clusters.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
    With K-mean clustering, we specify a desired number of clusters $K$. 
\end{note}

\textbf{Good} clustering is one for which the \textit{within-cluster variation} is as small as possible. The within-cluster variation for cluster $C_k$ is a measure $W(C_k)$ of the amount by which the observations within the cluster differ from each other. Hence we want to solve this problem:

\begin{equation*}
    \underset{C_1, \ldots, C_K}{\min}\left\{\sum_{k=1}^K W(C_k)\right\}
\end{equation*}

We ant to group the observations into $K$ clusters such that the total within-cluster variation, summed over all $K$ clusters, is as small as possible. %This within-cluster variation can be calculated in many ways, but we use the \textit{squared Euclidean distance}:

\begin{algo}
    K-means:

    \begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[SIR/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},]
%Nodes
\node[SIR] (1)     {Randomly assign each observation to a cluster ($1,\ldots, K)$};
\node[SIR] (2)[below=of 1] {Compute the cluster \textit{centroid}};
\node[SIR] (3) [below=of 2] {Assign each observation to the cluster whose centroid is closest};

%Lines
\draw[->, very thick] (1.south)  to node[right] {} (2.north);
\draw[->, very thick] (2.south)  to node[right] {} (3.north);
\draw[->, very thick] (3.east) .. controls  +(right:7mm) and +(right:7mm)   .. (2.east);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{algo}

The cluster centroid is defined as:

\begin{equation*}
    \hat{\mu}_k = \Bar{x}_k = \dfrac{1}{n_k}\sum_{i:k_i = k}x_i
\end{equation*}
where $i: k_i = k$ are the $n_k$ observations with $k_i = k$.

In our example, $W(C_k)$ is the deviance:

\begin{equation*}
    W(C_k) = D_k = \sum_{j=1}^p (X_{ij} - \mu_{kj)^2}
\end{equation*}

Thus, our total deviance of $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is 

\begin{equation*}
    D = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K 1_{k_i = k} \sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \mu_{kj})^2
\end{equation*}

\hl{But we do not know the cluster assignment $\{k_i\}_{i=1}^n$}. To minimise this deviance we have to estimate both the centroids and the assignment.

Objective: fit $\{\mu_k\}_{k=1}^K$ and $\{k_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to minimise the deviance

\begin{equation}
    \underset{\{\mu_k\}_{k=1}^K,\{k_i\}_{i=1}^n}{\min}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K 1_{k_i = k} \underbrace{\left[\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \mu_{kj})^2\right]}_{\text{within-cluster SS}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $k_i \in \{1,2,\ldots, K\}$ is the cluster assignment of observation $i$.

We can visualise this with the following figure

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=13cm]{pic/k-means algo.png}
    \caption{Steps of the K-means algorithm}
    \label{fig:k-means algo}
\end{figure}

We repeat the algorithm until the cluster assignment no longer changes (convergence).

\subsubsection{Cons of K-means}

\begin{shaded}
    Drawbacks of the K-means algorithm:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] How do we choose $K$. It is highly subjective.
        \item[-] Algorithm may converge on a local minima and not the global minima.
        \item[-] Local minima + initial randomisation means that multiple runs of the K-means algorithm on the same data may yield different results. 
    \end{itemize}

    To get around this we tend to do many runs with different initial random clusters and pick the run with the smallest sum-squared error.
\end{shaded}

It is common practice to report both the within- and between-cluster SS:

\begin{equation}
    \text{TSS} = \underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i=1}^n 1 _{k_i = k}\left[\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij} - \mu_{kj})^2\right]}_{\text{\textbf{within}-cluster SS}} + \underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i=1}^n 1 _{k_i = k}\left[\sum_{j=1}^p (\mu_{kj} - \mu_{j})^2\right]}_{\text{\textbf{between}-cluster SS}}
\end{equation}





\subsection{Factorisation by Principal Components}

\subsubsection{Factor Models}

Suppose we have data $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\mathbf{x}$ is a $p$-dimensional vector where $p$ is large. We may want to reduce $\mathbf{x}$ to a few important factors.

\begin{definition}
    Factor Model:

    $x_{ij}$ is a linear model of $K$ scalar factors $v_{i1}, v_{i2}, \ldots, v_{iK}$:

    \begin{equation*}
        \E(x_{ij}) = \varphi_{j1}v_{i1} + \varphi_{j2}v_{i2} + \ldots + \varphi_{jK}v_{iK}; \qquad i = 1,2,\ldots, n
    \end{equation*}
    where $\varphi_{jk}$ is a coefficient and $v_{ik}$ is amount of factor-$k$ in observation $i$.

    \begin{note}
        Factor $v_{ik}$ is unobserved (=latent)
    \end{note}

    $(\mathbf{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_K})$ is a set of low-dim regressors that capture the "essence" of $\mathbf{x}$. The $\varphi_{jk}$'s are the \textbf{loadings} or \textbf{rotations} that sets how much $v_{ik}$ goes into $x_{ij}$.
\end{definition}


We can rewrite this in vector notation:

\begin{equation*}
    \E(\mathbf{x}_i) = \varphi_1 v_{i1} + \varphi_2 v_{i2} + \ldots + \varphi_K v_{iK}
\end{equation*}

\begin{note}
    $\mathbf{x}_i =  (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ip})$ is $p$-vector. And each observation $i$ has $K$ factors, $v_{i1}, v_{i2}, \ldots, v_{iK}$. $v_{ik}$ is univariate whereas $\mathbf{v}_i = (v_{i1}, v_{i2}, \ldots, v_{iK})$ is a $K$-vector. The rotation vector $\varphi_k = (\varphi_{1k}, \varphi_{2k}, \ldots, \varphi_{pk})$ is a $p$-vector which translates the simple $K$-vector $\mathbf{v}_i$ to the complex $p$-vector $\mathbf{x}_i$.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Mixture models are Factor models!} $K$-means was motivated by a mixture model and is a special case of a factor model. However, mixture models only load on a single factor. \hl{Factor models allow for mixed membership: $x_{ij}$ don't have to be from one component, but can be a mix of shared latent factors.}


\subsection{PCA}
\label{sec:PCA}

PCA aims to find a low-dimensional representation of data that captures as much variance (information) as possible.

When faced with a large set of correlated variables, principle components allow us to summarise this set with a smaller number of representative variables that collectively explain most of the variability in the original set. \footnote{More info on PCA in Section \ref{appendix: dimension reduction}.}

PCA refers to the process of computing these components and using them to understand the data. This is an unsupervised approach as we only have the set of features $\mathbf{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p}$ and no associated response $\mathbf{y}$.

\subsubsection{2 variable example}

First, we will go over the example of $p=2$ variables.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{pic/pca 2p.png}
    \caption{Left: our variables as axes; Right: Principle Components as axes}
    \label{fig:pca2}
\end{figure}

In the left plot, our first principle component ($PC_1$) is shown as the diagonal line. Additionally, we can see that this line has the most variance, i.e. if it was any other line, our points in the right plot would be more bunched together. Again, once we have decided our $PC_1$, $PC_2$ will be the line that has the next most uncorrelated variance, and this by construction is the orthogonal line.

\begin{note}
    by construction in the 2 variable case, we will only have 2 principle components and they will be orthogonal. This means that $PC_2$ will be perpendicular to the diagonal line in the left plot. This is why we can plot $PC_1$ against $PC_2$ in the right plot.
\end{note}

\begin{procedure}
    The first Principle Component, $v_i^1$, is a weighted average across $x_{i1}$ and $x_{i2}$ with the maximum variance across the $n$ observations. That is:

    \begin{equation}
        \underset{\varphi_1, \varphi_2}{\max}\underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i^1)^2}_{\text{variance of PC1}} = \underset{\varphi_1, \varphi_2}{\max} \sum_{i=1}^n (\varphi_1 x_{i1} + \varphi_2 x_{i2})^2
    \end{equation}

    We constrain the maximisation problem with the following:
    \begin{equation*}
        \varphi_1^2 + \varphi_2^2 = 1
    \end{equation*}

    When choosing $\varphi_1, \varphi_2$ we are setting the direction in which we want to add variables, i.e. the rotation of the coordinate system.

    \begin{note}
        If we look back at Figure \ref{fig:pca2}, we can see that the transformation from the left plot to the right is the rotation of the coordinate system.
    \end{note}

    We then take out PC1, and work with the residualised data:

    \begin{equation*}
        \{\Tilde{x}_{i1}, \Tilde{x}_{i2}\}_{i=1}^n = \{x_{i1} - \varphi_1 v_{i1},x_{i2} - \varphi_2 v_{i1}\}_{i=1}^n
    \end{equation*}
    
\end{procedure}

\begin{example}
    When the maximum spread line is the 45 degree line, one can show that $\varphi_1 = \varphi_2 = \sqrt{1/2}$. That is:

    \begin{equation*}
        v_{i1} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{2}}(x_{i1} + x_{i2})
    \end{equation*}

    When we take out PC1, we are left with the residualised data:

    \begin{align*}
        \{\Tilde{x}_{i1}, \Tilde{x}_{i2}\}_{i=1}^n &= \{x_{i1} - \varphi_1 v_{i1},x_{i2} - \varphi_2 v_{i1}\}_{i=1}^n \\
        &= \{x_{i1} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} v_{i1},x_{i2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} v_{i1}\}_{i=1}^n \\
        &= \left\{x_{i1} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}(x_{i1} + x_{i2})\right),x_{i2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}(x_{i1}+x_{i2})\right)\right\}_{i=1}^n \\
         &= \left\{x_{i1} - \frac{1}{2}(x_{i1} + x_{i2}),x_{i2} - \frac{1}{2}(x_{i1}+x_{i2})\right\}_{i=1}^n \\
         &= \left\{\frac{1}{2}(x_{i1} + x_{i2}),\frac{1}{2}(x_{i2}-x_{i1})\right\}_{i=1}^n
    \end{align*}

    Then, our second principle component $v_{i2}$ is a weighted average of $\Tilde{x}_{i1}, \Tilde{x}_{i2}$, with the maximum residual variance across the $n$ observations. That is:

    \begin{equation}
        \underset{\varphi_1, \varphi_2}{\max}\underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i^2)^2}_{\text{variance of PC2}} = \underset{\varphi_1, \varphi_2}{\max} \sum_{i=1}^n (\varphi_1 \Tilde{x}_{i1} + \varphi_2 \Tilde{x}_{i2})^2
    \end{equation}

    We find that when $\varphi_1 = \varphi_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$:
    \begin{align*}
    v_{i1} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}(x_{i1} + x_{i2}) \\
    v_{i2} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}(x_{i1} - x_{i2})
    \end{align*}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Variance Accounting}

We will continue with the example in which $\varphi_1 = \varphi_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$. That is, the maximum variance line is the 45 degree line. We can find the variance of $v_{i1}$ and $v_{i2}$.

\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^n (v_{i1})^2 &= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{i1} + x_{i2})^2 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i2} + \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1} x_{i2} \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n (v_{i2})^2 &= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{i1} + x_{i2})^2 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i2} - \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i1} x_{i2}
\end{align*}

\begin{shaded}
    Our observations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $x_{i1}$ and $x_{i2}$ are correlated, the first principal component always has higher variance than the second.

        \item Together, the principal components explain all of the variance in $\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}\}_{i=1}^n$.
    \end{itemize}

    \hl{these observations generalise to factor models with $p$ variables.}
    
\end{shaded}

\subsubsection{General Model}

\begin{algo}

\begin{enumerate}
\hspace{1in}
    \item Set $\mathbf{\Tilde{X}^1 = X}$, an $n \times p$ matrix. Then for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, \min(n,p)$. 
    \item Find:
    \begin{equation}
        \varphi_k = \arg\underset{\varphi}{\max}\left\{\mathbb{V}ar\left(\mathbf{\Tilde{X}^1}\phi\right) = \mathbb{V}ar(v_{k1}, v_{k2}, \ldots, v_{kn})\right\}
    \end{equation}
    where $v_{ki} = \phi^\prime \mathbf{x}_i = \sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}\phi_{jk}$ and $\sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{jk}^2 = 1$
    \item Update rows of $\mathbf{\Tilde{X}^{k+1}}$ via $\mathbf{\Tilde{x}_i^k} - v_{ik} \times \varphi_k$
\end{enumerate}

\end{algo}

The PCA algo repeatedly fits both rotations and factors to minimise deviance across dimensions $j=1,2, \ldots, p$ and obs $i=1,2, \ldots, n$ for factor model

$$
\tilde{x}_{i j}^{k} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(v_{i k} \varphi_{j k}, \sigma_{k}^{2}\right)
$$
where $\tilde{x}_{i j}^{k}=\tilde{x}_{i j}^{k-1}-v_{i, k-1} \varphi_{k-1, j}$.

\begin{note}
    We haven't exactly described the algorithm, but we have described the intuition. In practice, the algo is minimising deviance.

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{p} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i j}-\sum_{k=1}^{K} \phi_{j k} v_{i k}\right)^{2}
$$
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Relationship between PCA and Factor Models}

The factor model interprets the data as

$$
\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right)=\varphi_{1} v_{i 1}+\varphi_{2} v_{i 2}+\ldots+\varphi_{K} v_{i K}=\Phi \mathbf{v}_{i} ; \quad i=1,2, \ldots, n
$$
Applying PCA we look for principal components such that

$$
v_{i k}=\varphi_{1 k} x_{i 1}+\varphi_{2 k} x_{i 2}+\ldots+\varphi_{p k} x_{i p}=\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\prime} \varphi_{k} ; \quad i=1,2, \ldots, n ; k=1,2, \ldots, K
$$

Stacking the $K$ PCs $\mathrm{PC}_{i}=\left(P C_{i 1}, P C_{i 2}, \ldots, P C_{i K}\right)$ implies

$$
\mathbf{P C}_{i}=\Phi^{\prime} \mathbf{x}_{i} ; \quad i=1,2, \ldots, n
$$

where $\Phi=\left(\varphi_{1}, \varphi_{2}, \ldots, \varphi_{K}\right)$ is a $p \times K$ matrix of PCA rotations.

By construction, the PCA rotation matrix is orthogonal $\Phi^{\prime} \Phi=\mathbf{I}$; hence,

$$
\Phi \mathrm{PC}_{i}=\Phi \Phi^{\prime} \mathbf{x}_{i}=\mathbf{x}_{i}
$$

so there is a factor model where factors are PCs from our PCA

\subsubsection{Number of PCs}

Unless the PCs are used for downstream prediction, it is difficult to cross-validate the number of PCs, $K$. People often look at \hl{the proportion of the total variance accounted for by a certain number of PCs}

\begin{align*}
    \text { Total Variance }=\sum_{j=1}^{p} \operatorname{Var}\left(x_{j}\right)&=\sum_{j=1}^{p} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i j}^{2} \\
    \text{Variance explained by the \textit{k}th PC, }\operatorname{Var}\left(P C_{i k}\right)&=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} PC_{i k}^{2} \\
    \text{Proportion of variance explained by \textit{K} PCs, }&=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} P C_{i k}^{2}}{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i j}^{2}}
\end{align*}

\section{Experiments and Controls}

The aim of experiments is to find causal relationships between variables. This is much harder than just prediction. You need to make \textbf{"what if ..."} (counterfactual) predictions, and we will discuss ways of doing that.

\subsection{Potential Outcomes Framework}

Suppose the treatment $d$ is binary, i.e.

$$
d= \begin{cases}1 & \text { Treatment } \\ 0 & \text { No treatment }\end{cases}
$$

The outcome $y$ would depend on the treatment:

$$
y= \begin{cases}y(1) & \text { Treatment, } d=1 \\ y(0) & \text { No treatment. } d=0\end{cases}
$$

Meaning subject $i$ has the potential outcomes $\{y_i(1), y_i(0)\}$ and a treatment effect of $y_i(1) - y_i(0)$. The \hl{average treatment effect} (ATE) takes the expectation across subjects (i.e. the average)

$$
ATE \equiv \mathbb{E}[y(1)-y(0)]
$$

When we observe subject $i$'s outcome, they will either be treated or not: $y_i = y_i(1)$ or $y_i = y_i(0)$, but never both. We need an unobserved counterfactual:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_i(0)$ if $d_i = 1$: can be interpreted as the outcome of the treated subject $i$ if they had not been treated.
    \item $y_i(1)$ if $d_i = 0$: can be interpreted as the outcome of the non-treated subject $i$ had they been treated.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
    We can never get individual counterfactuals, but we can find the average counterfactual
\end{note}

 For example, if $\mathbb{E}[y(1) \mid d=1]=\mathbb{E}[y(1)]$ and $\mathbb{E}[y(0) \mid d=0]=\mathbb{E}[y(0)]$, straightforward to compute the desired ATE as
\begin{align*}
    A T E & \equiv \mathbb{E}[y(1)-y(0)] \\
& =\mathbb{E}[y(1)]-\mathbb{E}[y(0)] \\
& =\mathbb{E}[y(1) \mid d=1]-\mathbb{E}[y(0) \mid d=0] \\
& =\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[y \mid d=1]}_{\text {Observed }}-\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[y \mid d=0]}_{\text {Observed }}
\end{align*}

Our initial assumptions, $\mathbb{E}[y(1) \mid d=1]=\mathbb{E}[y(1)]$ and $\mathbb{E}[y(0) \mid d=0]=\mathbb{E}[y(0)]$ imply random treatment assignment


\subsection{Randomised Controlled Trials}

Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the golden standard for evaluating treatment effects. Very simple premise. If you want to know what the treatment $d$ does to an outcome $y$, test out $d$ on a subset of the sample (say 50\%) a.k.a the treatment group, and compare the outcomes to the rest of the same, the control group.

\hl{Random treatment assignment} means that $d$ is independent of the rotational outcomes $y(1)$ and $y(0)$, which gives us:
\begin{align*}
    A T E & \equiv \mathbb{E}[y(1)-y(0)] \\
& =\mathbb{E}[y(1)]-\mathbb{E}[y(0)] \\
& =\mathbb{E}[y(1) \mid d=1]-\mathbb{E}[y(0) \mid d=0] \\
& =\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[y \mid d=1]}_{\text {Observed }}-\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[y \mid d=0]}_{\text {Observed }}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Estimating ATE in RCT}

It is easy to estimate ATE in RCT due to the random treatment assignment.

\begin{procedure}
    Consider an RCT with random binary treatment assignment and outcomes: $\{d_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where $\sum_{i=1}^n d_i = n_1$ (number of treated subjects) and $\sum_{i=1}^n (1-d_i) = n-n_1 = n_0$. The total sample is split into two, treated $n_1$ and non-treated $n_0$. Total subjects is $n$.

    Because of our random treatment assignment, we know that the difference in average outcomes between the treatment and control groups is \hl{caused} by the treatment. Therefore, if $\Bar{y}_1\equiv \frac{1}{n_1}\sum_{i=1}^n d_iy_i$ and $\Bar{y}_0 \equiv \frac{1}{n_0}\sum_{i=1}^n(1-d_i)y_i$, then we know that the estimated ATE will be:
    \begin{equation}
        \widehat{ATE} = \Bar{y}_1 - \Bar{y}_0
    \end{equation}
    and will be a very good estimator for ATE (consistent under the law of large numbers). We can also find the standard errors very easily if the observations are independent:

    \begin{equation*}
        SE(\widehat{ATE}) = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n_0}\widehat{\mathbb{V}ar}(y_i|d_i=0) + \dfrac{1}{n_1}\widehat{\mathbb{V}ar}(y_i|d_i=1)}
    \end{equation*}
\end{procedure}

\begin{note}
    The standard central limit theorem implies asymptotic normality.
\end{note}

\subsubsection{Near-experimental designs}
RCTs are often unfeasible and impractical. In these cases, we look for near-experimental variation in observational data to recover treatment effects. We need to include many more assumptions, but we will ignore this. 

You have to find groups of observations that may act as treatment and control groups, even if the treatment assignment is not explicitly random. Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Difference-in-Difference analysis
    \item Regression discontinuity analysis
    \item Instrumental variable analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conditional Ignorability}

Now we will focus on the use of machine learning to facilitate causal analysis in conditional ignorability and LTE cases.

When we don't have experimental data we have to look at observational data. Instead of controlling for treatment, you are stuck observing what happened when treatment varied in an uncontrolled manner. In these sorts of studies (observation studies) \hl{estimation of the counterfactuals depend on the assumption of conditional ignorability}.

\paragraph{Confounding co-influences:} We must control for all confounding co-influences on treatment $d$ and outcome $y$. These confounding co-influences (or confounders) are variables that simultaneously affect $d$ and $y$. There are always lots of confounders in observational studies, meaning we must do high-dimensional controlling which is where machine learning comes in.

\begin{procedure}
    \hspace{1in}
    Data is $\{d_i, \mathbf{x}_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where potential outcomes means $y_i = y(d_i)$. If we had an RCT, random treatment assignment \textit{implies} that $d_i$ is independent of the potential outcomes $y(d_i)$ i.e.
    \begin{equation*}
        \{y_i(1), y_i(0)\} \ind d_i
    \end{equation*}

    However, if data is observational, $d_i$ is not independent of potential outcomes $y(d_i)$.
    \begin{example}
        University attendance, $d$, is affected by academic ability $x$, but so are potential outcomes $y(d_i)$. In this example, our independence condition does not hold.
    \end{example}

    If we control (= hold fixed) confounders, we have \hl{conditional independence and therefore conditional ignorability}:
    \begin{equation*}
        \{y_i(1), y_i(0)\} \ind d_i |\mathbf{x}_i
    \end{equation*}

    You can see that conditional ignorability hinges on $\mathbf{x}_i$. In our example, $\mathbf{x}_i$ must include academic ability or at least a good proxy for it.
\end{procedure}

\subsection{Linear Treatment Effect Model}

The linear treatment effects (LTE) model is:

\begin{align*}
    y &= \gamma d + \mathbf{x^\prime}\beta + \epsilon, \quad \E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{x}] = 0 \\
    d &= \mathbf{x^\prime}\tau + \upsilon, \quad \E[\upsilon|\mathbf{x}] = 0
\end{align*}

The first equation looks like normal regression for prediction. \textbf{But} our specification of the conditional error is new. $\E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{x}] = 0$, allows interpretation of $\gamma$ as a causal effect of $d$ on $y$. 

the second equation is saying that $\mathbf{x}$ contains \textbf{all} variables affecting $d$ and $y$.

\begin{note}
    The LTE model is a structural model meaning it specifies the relation between unobserved $\epsilon$ and observed $d,\mathbf{x}$; unlike a reduced form model which only specifies the relationship between observable variables.

    This distinction is core to the distinction between prediction and causal inference.
\end{note}

\begin{procedure}
    \hspace{1in}
    Suppose conditional ignorability (on $\mathbf{x}$) ignorability holds, i.e. $\E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{x}] = 0$. We partition $\mathbf{x} = \{\mathbf{z,w}\}$ and assume $\E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{w}]\neq 0$. We observe $\mathbf{z}$, but not $\mathbf{w}$.

    Suppose you want to predict $y$ form $(d,\mathbf{z})$. We use the conditional (on $d,\mathbf{z}$) mean function of $y$: $\E(y|d,\mathbf{z})$.

    We can estimate $\E(y|d,\mathbf{z})$ by OLS on:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{LTE OLS}
        y = \alpha d + \eta \mathbf{w} + u
    \end{equation}

    where $u \equiv y - \alpha d - \eta \mathbf{w}$.
\end{procedure}

As long as the average relationship between $y, d, \mathbf{z}$ i.e. $\E(y|d,\mathbf{z})$ is stable, the prediction model works well.

\begin{note}
    \textbf{But} $\hat{\alpha}$ is a poor estimate of the average treatment effect = $\gamma$.
\end{note}

\begin{shaded}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Prediction}: we are not concerned with $\E[\epsilon|d, \mathbf{w}]=0$ so we use the reduced form models
        \item \textbf{Causal Inference}: We need $\E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{x}]=0$ as it guards against OVB, so we use structural models. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{shaded}

\subsubsection{Fitting an LTE model}

\begin{procedure}
    Recall we have the LTE model:

    \begin{align*}
    y &= \gamma d + \mathbf{x^\prime}\beta + \epsilon, \quad \E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{x}] = 0 \\
    d &= \mathbf{x^\prime}\tau + \upsilon, \quad \E[\upsilon|\mathbf{x}] = 0
\end{align*}

Suppose you have data $(d_i, \mathbf{x}_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n$ where $\mathbf{x}$ is a p-vector. \hl{If $n\gg p$, we don't need to worry about the second equation. We can just estimate the first by OLS and $\hat{\gamma}$ is a good estimator of $\gamma$}

\begin{note}
    To justify $\E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{x}]=0$ we need $p$ to be large. If $p>n$ you can't estimate the first equation by OLS and need to select regressors. We can do this by using a \textbf{lasso.}
\end{note}
\end{procedure}

\subsection{LTE Lasso}

When we have many confounders, especially when $p>n$, you need to model treatment assignment in the LTE model (include the second equation). We consider the lasso and cross-validation method.

\begin{shaded}
Difference between lasso for prediction and LTE:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prediction lasso}: Get a path of the candidate model by varying the penalty, and we pick the weight which gives rise to the model with the best cross-validated out-of-sample predictive performance.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This works well to get a model that predicts new data from the \hl{same joint distribution} of $(\mathbf{x}, y)$ as the old data.
        \item In our treatment effects, the joint distribution changes when $d$ changes so it does not work well. The effect of $d$ on $y$ when $d$ moves independently of $x$, i.e. a \hl{new joint distribution $(d, \mathbf{x}, y)$ when $d$ changes}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LTE lasso}: removes the effect of the confounders that are correlated with $d$ from treatment effect and estimates $\hat{\gamma}$. It can handle large sets of confounders i.e. when $p$ is large.
\end{itemize}
\end{shaded}

\begin{procedure}
    We have the LTE model:

    \begin{align*}
    y &= \gamma d + \mathbf{x^\prime}\beta + \epsilon, \quad \E[\epsilon|d,\mathbf{x}] = 0 \\
    d &= \mathbf{x^\prime}\tau + \upsilon, \quad \E[\upsilon|\mathbf{x}] = 0
    \end{align*}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We first model the treatment assignment $\E[d|\mathbf{x}]$
        \item We then use the fitted values $\hat{d} = \mathbf{x^\prime}\hat{\tau}$ as additional controls in the response equation (first one).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{procedure}

The fitted values $\hat{d}$ in the 2nd stage control for the effect of $\mathbf{x}$ on treatment assignment and isolates random variation in $d$ coming from $\upsilon$
\begin{note}
    The random variation in $d$ coming from $\upsilon$ can be thought of as little experiments in $d$, \hl{so we can use the fitted values $\hat{d}$ to create a near-experimental design}.
\end{note}

Everything hinges on having fitted values $\hat{d}$ that captures the relevant influences on $\mathbf{x}$ on $d$, but the lasso can be good for this.

\begin{algo}
\hspace{1in}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Cross-validate a lasso to estimate $\E[d|\mathbf{x}] = \mathbf{x^\prime}\tau$ and collect the fitted values $\hat{d} = \mathbf{x^\prime}\hat{\tau}$
        \item Cross validate a lasso to estimate:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{2nd step LTE lasso}
            \E[y|\mathbf{x}, d] = \vartheta \hat{d} + \gamma d + \mathbf{x^\prime}\beta
        \end{equation}
        with no penalty on $\hat{d}$, because we need to keep control to maintain the conditional ignorability and if we were to penalise $\hat{d}$ the coefficient would go to 0 and we would lose it.
        \item Then, our $\hat{\gamma}$ is our estimate of the treatment effect of $d$ on $y$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algo}

\subsubsection{Why does the LTE lasso work?}

When we combine the two LTE model equations:

\begin{equation*}
    \E[y|\mathbf{x},d] = \gamma d + \mathbf{x^\prime}\beta = \gamma\upsilon + \mathbf{x^\prime}(\gamma\tau + \beta) = \gamma\upsilon + \mathbf{x^\prime}\tilde{\beta}
\end{equation*}

Controlling for our fitted values $\hat{d}$ unpenalised in the second step means that we can estimate the effect of the residuals $\hat{\upsilon}$ which is independent of cofounder influence in $\hat{d}$.

\begin{note}
    The special thing about LTE lasso is that it handles large $p$ and automatically picks out the relevant predictors of treatment assignment.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
    the LTE lasso gives point estimates of the treatment effect but \hl{does not have good inferential properties i.e. standard errors}
\end{note}

\section{Dimension Reduction Methods}

\label{appendix: dimension reduction}

With our simple models, we look at controlling our variance by either using a subset of the original variables, or we shrink the coefficients towards zero i.e. using predictors $\mathbf{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p}$. \hl{Dimension reduction methods are a class of approach that transforms the predictors and then fits a least squares model using the transformed variables}.

\begin{definition}
    Let $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_M$ represent $M<p$ \textit{linear combinations} of our original $p$ predictors. 

    \begin{equation*}
        Z_m = \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{jm}\mathbf{x_j}
    \end{equation*}

    for some constants $\phi_{1m}, \phi_{2m}, \ldots, \phi_{pm}$ for $m= 1, \ldots, M$. We can then fit the linear regression model:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{dim reduction lin reg}
        y_i = \theta_0 + \sum_{m=1}^M \theta_m z_{im} + \epsilon_i, \qquad i = 1, \ldots, n
    \end{equation}
    using least squares. All dimension reduction methods work in two steps:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Get the transformed predictors $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_M$.
        \item Fit the model with these $M$ predictors. 
    \end{enumerate}
    However, the choice of our new predictors (or equivalently the $\phi_{jm}$'s) can be achieved in different ways.
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
    Notice:

    \begin{equation*}
        \sum_{m=1}^M \theta_m z_{im} = \sum_{m=1}^M \theta_m \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{jm}x_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^p \sum_{m=1}^M \theta_m \phi_{jm} x_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{ij},
    \end{equation*}
    where
    \begin{equation*}
        \beta_j = \sum_{m=1}^M \theta_m \phi_{jm}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{note}

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}

PCA is a technique for reducing the dimension of an $n \times p$ data matrix $\mathbf{x}$. The \textit{first principal component} direction of the data is that along which the observations \textbf{vary the most} (more variance = more information = better regressor).
